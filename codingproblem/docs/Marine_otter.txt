 The marine otter (Lontra felina) is a rare and relatively unknown South American mammal of the weasel family (Mustelidae).
The scientific name means "feline otter", and in Spanish, the marine otter is also often referred to as gato marino: "marine cat".
The marine otter (while spending much of its time out of the water) only lives in saltwater, coastal environments and rarely ventures into freshwater or estuarine habitats.
This saltwater exclusivity is unlike most other otter species, except for the almost fully aquatic sea otter (Enhydra lutris) of the North Pacific.
The teeth are developed for slicing instead of crushing.
The marine otter does not display sexual dimorphism.
Marine otters are found in littoral areas of southwestern South America, close to shore and in the intertidal areas of northern Peru (from the port of Chimbote), along the entire coast of Chile, and the extreme southern reaches of Argentina.
Occasional vagrant sightings still occur as far afield as the Falkland Islands.
The marine otter mainly inhabits rocky shorelines with abundant seaweed and kelp, and infrequently visits estuaries and freshwater rivers.
It appears to select habitats with surprisingly high exposure to strong swells and winds, unlike many other otters, which prefer calmer waters.
Caves and crevices in the rocky shorelines may provide them with the cover they need, and often a holt will have no land access at high tide.
Marine otters avoid sandy beaches.
Rocky intertidal zones with natural crevices are ideal for marine otter dens and feeding areas.
Because most of their time is spent hidden in caves, their behavior is difficult to observe.
Marine otters actively avoid humans.
In response to human activity, they will spend less time on coasts and stray from their dens during the day to fissures inaccessible to humans.
