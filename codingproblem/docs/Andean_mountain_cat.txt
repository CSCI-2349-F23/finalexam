Oreailurus jacobita The Andean mountain cat (Leopardus jacobita) is a small wild cat native to the high Andes that has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because fewer than 1,500 individuals are thought to exist in the wild.
It is traditionally considered a sacred animal by indigenous Aymara and Quechua people.
The Andean mountain cat was first described by Emilio Cornalia who named it in honor of Jacobita Mantegazza.
It is a monotypic species.
The Andean mountain cat has ashy-gray fur, a grey head, face and rounded ears.
The nose and lips are black with the areas around them being white; two dark brown lines run from the corners of the eyes across the cheeks.
There are some black spots on the forelegs, yellowish-brown blotches on the flanks, and up to two narrow, dark rings on the hind limbs.
The long bushy tail has six to nine rings, which are dark brown to black.
The markings of juveniles are darker and smaller than those of adults.
The Andean mountain cat and pampas cat look similar.
This makes it difficult to identify which cat is observed and makes correct estimations of populations problematic.
This can be especially difficult when attempting to gain correct information from the observations of individuals that have seen one of these cats but are not aware to look for specific features to distinguish between the two.
The Andean mountain cat lives only at high elevations in the Andes.
Records in Argentina indicate that it lives at elevations from 1,800 m (5,900 ft) in the southern Andes to over 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in Chile, Bolivia and central Peru.
This terrain is arid, sparsely vegetated, rocky and steep showing that the Andean Mountain Cat prefers a temperate and terrestrial habitat.
