Have you ever spent six hours at an airport? Let me rephrase
that. Have you ever spent six hours at an airport on purpose?

Earlier this month, I arrived at Logan several hours before my
flight was scheduled to depart to get better acquainted with
the newly expanded Terminal E. Its lipstick-red exterior is already
one of Boston’s splashiest new landmarks. Still, the interior, which
quietly debuted last summer and officially opened in the fall‚ has
yet to receive the same attention or admiration.

In many ways, the interior of the expanded Terminal E is just as
forward-looking as the scarlet exterior (the color is officially
called Boston Red). The 320,000-square-foot expansion, with its
soaring roofline and walls of windows, is a welcome change from the
low-slung original 1974 terminal. The forward-looking design from
architect Luis Vidal subtly mirrors and updates Eero Saarinen’s spacious
1962 TWA terminal in New York. The design brings a welcome splash of
architectural optimism to East Boston.
